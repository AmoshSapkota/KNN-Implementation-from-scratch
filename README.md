CSE-6363 Machine Learning, Fall 2023 - Programming Assignment 1
Overview
This repository contains the implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm and its evaluation using k-fold cross-validation, as part of the CSE-6363 Machine Learning course for Fall 2023.

Assignment Description
For this assignment, you will implement the KNN algorithm from scratch and create functions to evaluate it using k-fold cross-validation (also from scratch). You are encouraged to enhance the basic implementation by incorporating additional features and improvements.

Objectives
Implement the KNN algorithm from scratch.
Implement k-fold cross-validation from scratch.
Evaluate the KNN algorithm using 10-fold cross-validation on specified datasets.
Compare the accuracy of your KNN implementation with the KNN implementation from scratch.
Document the process, results, and references used.
Datasets
The following datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository will be used:

Hayes-Roth Dataset
Car Evaluation Dataset
Breast Cancer Dataset
